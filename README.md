# The Elements of Computing Systems

*Building a Modern Computer from First Principles*

This is a great book, with a hardware simulator and just one primitive gate - the nand gate - the reader builds a modern computer from scratch. This goes all the way from building other gates from the nand gate up to an operating system. 

Ever wondered how RAM works, why CPUs are clocked, what is the theoretical underpinning of virtual machines? This book answers it all. 

In this repository I am documenting my progress.
